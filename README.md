# Advent of Code

This is a project to solve the Advent of Code puzzles using PHP.

## Project scaffold for [Tempest](https://github.com/tempestphp), an MVC micro framework that gets out of your way.

Read all about Tempest in [the docs](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-docs/blob/master/01-getting-started.md).

## Installation
If you want to start a new Tempest project, you can use tempest/app as the starting point. Use composer create-project to start:

```bash
composer create-project tempest/app my-app --stability alpha
cd my-app
```
The project scaffold includes a basic frontend setup including Tailwind:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can access your app by using PHP's built-in server.

```bash
./tempest serve
PHP 8.3.3 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started
```
